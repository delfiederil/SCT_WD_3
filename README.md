**🎯 SCT_WD_3 – Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application**

**📘 Overview**

This project is part of the SkillCraft Technology Web Development Internship (Task 03).

The goal of this task is to design and develop an interactive Tic-Tac-Toe web application where two players (or a player and the computer) can play dynamically through a responsive web interface.

The project focuses on handling user interactions, maintaining game state, and detecting winning or draw conditions using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**✨ Features**

🎮 Two-Player Mode – Play against another player on the same device.

💻 Play vs Computer – Challenge a computer opponent for solo play.

🧠 Dynamic Game State – Tracks player moves and updates the board automatically.

✅ Win Detection – Checks for winning combinations after every move.

🌀 Draw Condition – Declares a tie when all cells are filled.

🔄 Reset Functionality – Quickly restart the game with a single click.

🎨 Responsive UI – Works seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

🌈 Clean and Minimal Design – Simple, elegant, and engaging interface.

**🧩 Technologies Used**

HTML – for the structure of the web page.

CSS – for styling, layout, and responsive design.

JavaScript – for handling logic, interactions, and game state management.

**⚙️ How It Works**

The board consists of a 3×3 grid.

Players alternate turns placing “X” or “O” in available cells.

The program checks for a winner or draw after each move.

A message is displayed when a player wins or when the game ends in a draw.

Players can reset the board anytime to play again.

**🧠 Learning Outcomes**

Tracking and updating dynamic states in real-time.
