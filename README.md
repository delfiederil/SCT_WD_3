🎯 SCT_WD_3
🕹️ Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application
📌 Project Overview

This project is part of the SkillCraft Technology Web Development Internship (Task 03).
The goal is to build a Tic-Tac-Toe web application where two players (or a player and the computer) can play interactively through a web interface.

💡 Features

🎮 Two-player mode (Player vs Player)

💻 Option to play against the computer (Player vs Computer)

🧠 Tracks game state dynamically

✅ Detects winning combinations automatically

🔁 Displays draw conditions

🔄 Reset button to start a new game

🎨 Simple and responsive UI

🧩 Technologies Used

HTML – for structure

CSS – for styling and layout

JavaScript – for interactivity and game logic

⚙️ How It Works

The board is a 3×3 grid.

Players take turns clicking empty cells to place “X” or “O”.

JavaScript tracks each move and checks for:

A win (three in a row, column, or diagonal)

A draw (when all cells are filled and no winner)

The game displays the result and allows resetting.

🧠 Learning Outcome

This project helped me understand:

Event handling in JavaScript

DOM manipulation

Game state management

Logic implementation for win/draw detection

Enhancing UI responsiveness
